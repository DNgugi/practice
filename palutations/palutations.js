/**
 * Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of
a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A
permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just
dictionary words.


SIGNATURE:
Str. -> Bool.

PURPOSE:
Check if the string given can be rearranged into atleast one palindrome

STUB:
const palutations = (str) => {
    return false;
}

EXAMPLE
Input: Tact Coa
Output: True (permutations: "taco cat'; "atco cta")

 tactcoapapa -> true 
 */

//aboxxx xxoba

const palutations = (str) => {
  //all palindromes have one unique middle character?
  //even lengths must have even letter counts
  //odd lengths can have one and only one odd count letter
  return false;
};

module.exports = palutations;
